# Let It Rain

[![Modrinth](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/eQOTUNkk?label=Modrinth&logo=modrinth)](https://modrinth.com/mod/letitrain)

A Minecraft Fabric mod, which keeps the weather when sleeping.

This is a modern and fabric version of [Yermolim's Keep The Rain](https://github.com/yermolim/keep-the-rain).

## Toggling

Within the config directory is the config file `let-it-rain.json`.

The chances are in %, so `100` is always, and `0` is to never restore weather.

## Versions

This is a simple mod. The listed versions are just versions I currently need (and a few 1.20.x more).

If you need another version, open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/UnknownUser95/LetItRain/issues).

### Maintenance

I'm not sure if I'll update this mod to modern versions. I'm not into modding Minecraft, nor am I playing it that often. Right now I'm playing with Create, which is why I'm doing this.

As I said before, open a ticket, and I'll see what I can do.
